          The IKA Plate (RCT digital) has a round top made of aluminum alloy. It stirs volumes of up to 20l (H2o) and runs at speeds ranging from 50-1500rpm.

          Some of the features are: IKA emphasizes ease-of-use by design simplicity: reduced forms and operating elements meet the modernity of smartphones: IKA not only focuses on hardened glass because of visibility, chemical resistance and safety, it also optically changes the game of a magnetic stirrer with a glass surface. The IKA Plate (RCT digital) improves over time with regular firmware updates. Using Alnico magnetic technology, the IKA Plate (RCT digital) achieves excellent temperature stability and high residual induction. It also provides for maximum vortex.  The integrated timer and counter function supports the control of kinetics and sensitive reactions; the IKA SmartTemp® function protects users intelligently and predictably.

          Automatic switch-off of the magnetic stirrer if the connected external temperature sensor is not immersed in the medium. Function selectable, timeout time adjustable (Error 5).

        description: `
            
            The IKA ULTRA-TURRAX UTL 2000 is inline high-performance single-stage dispersing machine used for the production of emulsions and suspensions. The UTL 2000 uses the rotor-stator principle and is best suited for continuous applications that cannot be accomplished using conventional stirring methods.

            The UTL single stage dispersing machine is equipped with a mixing tool (generator) that provides moderate shear for the general purpose of blending and homogenizing processes. In order to configure the UTL to meet a variety of application needs, IKA offers a wide selection of generators for all machine sizes. Different generator designs allow adjusting the level of dispersing energy. In addition, they are also designed to accommodate materials of different viscosities and initial particle size.

            The ULTRA-TURRAX in-line machine UTL uses similar shear principles as the popular ULTRA-TURRAX machines UTC for batch operations. The UTL can be used for single pass operations or in a recirculation loop with a batch tank or reactor. Minimized volume of the mixing chamber ensures uniform shear on the product.

            In batch process the machine UTL is arranged in recirculation over a mixing vessel.

            During the full continuous process the components to be mixed are fed into the machine at an appropriate rate through various inlet connections. These components are then thoroughly mixed, dispersed or homogenized within the machine and discharged from the machine through the outlet. Thus, all particles or droplets are treated producing a narrow particle or droplet size distribution with minimal concentration/quality variations. Additionally, the UTL 2000 creates a pumping action which can be used for transfer purposes at low to moderate viscosities with a maximum of about 20 m (ca. 2 bar).

            The high shear dispersing machine ULTRA-TURRAX UTL 2000 is available in eight sizes. The possible throughput varies from 50 l/h up to 125.000 l/h. All sizes of machines work with the same circumferential speed of the rotor which provides for a reliable scale-up.

The first level of the dispersing machine DBI 2000 has a bottom stirrer and a special pump rotor that creates turbulence in the vessel and high circulation capacities, even for highly-viscous products. The second stage of the dispersing machine DBI 2000 is equipped with a rotor-stator system that ensures qualitative homogenizing and tight particle size distribution. The suction of powders or liquids directly into the mixing chamber of the dispersing machine DBI 2000 is possible without an additional vacuum pump.

            2-stage operation for homogeneous products: Upper stage with pump rotor for powerful throughput. In the lower stage, a rotor-stator system generates high shear forces. This results in stable dispersions and narrow particle size distributions
            Due to the strong negative pressure in the dispersion chamber, liquid and solid additives are sucked in reliably
            During cleaning, the DBI can serve as a CIP pump for the SPP plant
