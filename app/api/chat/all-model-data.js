        description: `
            ElectraSyn 2.0 is a three-in-one device that runs electrosynthesis, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and room temperature stirring. Its beginner-friendly features allow synthetic chemist to run simple CV and explore the substrate’s electrochemical properties; set up constant current or constant voltage reactions in the most intuitive way.

            We constantly strive to further optimize our devices for you. That is why our development never stops. The device keeps evolving with software development which enables state-of-art functionalities benefitting scientific discovery. Accessories are widely available in order to support the expanded functionalities.

            The IKA ElectraSyn App (available for both iPhone and Android) enables reaction and CV experiment monitoring, data transfer, and various other functions.

            The CV package is included in the pro package.
