        description: `
            The HABITAT cell control tower offers an optimized bioreactor-solution for cell culture applications, enabling precise monitoring and control of cell culture processes. It consists of a control unit with comprehensive connectivity options for gas supply, liquid addition, multi-parameter sensors, and temperature regulation, along with a user-friendly tablet interface for seamless bioreactor operation and control.

          Control and monitoring
          The intuitive software allows easy control and monitoring of the bioprocess and associated parameters via a 10.4-inch tablet. Users can select from batch, fed-batch, and perfusion/continuous operating modes, catering to various cell culture techniques. The innovative Chaotic Mixing function enables efficient and homogeneous mixing when required. The control software provides clear calibration management, real-time data visualization, and complete process documentation, ensuring compliance with FDA CFR Part 11 requirements (optional).

          Gas supply
          Precise and adjustable gassing is achieved through four individual built-in mass flow controllers for four each separate gas line (N2, O2, air and CO2), enabling flow rates of 0.01 – 2 L / min. tailored to cell growth requirements. By using the integrated and freely customizable cascade control system, each gas flow can be automatically adjusted by the software at any time according to the ambient conditions in order to maintain the target parameters.

          Liquid supply
          Four integrated Watson-Marlow pumps with adjustable direction and speed offer highest precision and versatility in pumping in and out acid, base, anti-foam agents and feeding solutions for mammalian cell culture media management.

          Sensors
          HABITAT Bioreactor comes equipped with latest technology sensors to precisely monitor and control critical bioprocess parameters. The following sensors are included in our standard sales vessel packages:
          • pH
          • DO (dissolved oxygen)
          • temperature
          • filling level
          • foam
          Optional sensors: CO2, Conductivity, Turbidity, Viable cell mass, Redox, Off-gas analysis and more.

          PID temperature control
          The integrated PID control ensures precise temperature regulation at all times, regardless of vessel type (single-wall or double-wall) or fill level. Single-wall glass vessels can be heated with a heating blanket, allowing for accurate temperature settings above room temperature. With the optional use of a cooling finger, it is also possible to achieve temperatures below room temperature. For double-wall vessels, in combination with an IKA thermostat, the temperature range can be freely adjusted between 5-80°C, independent of room conditions or heat generated by the culture itself.

        description: `
            The HABITAT photo cell control tower includes LED panels essential for transforming your HABITAT research bioreactor into a photobioreactor. It enables precise monitoring and control of various bioprocesses and, as a photobioreactor, it is ideal for applications involving photosynthetic organisms, such as algae cultivation.

            Photobioreactors facilitate the growth of photosynthetic organisms by providing controlled light exposure and environmental conditions, crucial for processes like biofuel production and carbon dioxide sequestration.

            The system includes two LED panels, the control unit with all connection options for the gas supply, liquid addition, sensors and temperature control as well as a tablet for simple and clear operation of the bioreactor.

            Control and monitoring
            The intuitive software allows easy control and monitoring of the bioprocess and associated parameters via a 10.4-inch tablet. Users can select from batch, fed-batch, and perfusion/continuous operating modes, catering to various cell culture techniques.

            ElectraSyn 2.0 Package
            ElectraSyn 2.0 is a three-in-one device that runs electrosynthesis, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and room temperature stirring. Its beginner-friendly features allow synthetic chemist to run simple CV and explore the substrate’s electrochemical properties; set up constant current or constant voltage reactions in the most intuitive way.

            We constantly strive to further optimize our devices for you. That is why our development never stops. The device keeps evolving with software development which enables state-of-art functionalities benefitting scientific discovery. Accessories are widely available in order to support the expanded functionalities.

            The IKA ElectraSyn App (available for both iPhone and Android) enables reaction and CV experiment monitoring, data transmitting, and various other functions.

            The CV package is not included in the standard package.

        category: "Magnetic Stirrers",
        description: `
            
         IKA TWISTER is a universal and compact mixing and twisting device with magnetic drive. In the IKA TWISTER SET 1, one drive is included.

          In the default version, IKA TWISTER is a powerful single-position magnetic stirrer for mixing up to 5 liters at a maximum speed of 3000 rpm and a viscosity of up to 500 mPas.

          The impressive stirring performance leads to strong twister like effects and excellent mixing results in a very short time.

          By connecting additional IKA TWISTER stirring units (available as accessories, ID no. 0020112621), IKA TWISTER can be expanded to a multi-position magnetic stirrer with up to 30 stirring positions.* The stirring positions can be controlled either separately or simultaneously (leader-follower principle).

          Versatile accessories
          With the multi-position stirring attachment TW.IX, the drive is transformed into a magnetic stirrer with 9 stirring positions for efficient mixing of sample vessels with small volumes (8 - 60 ml).
          The TW.VX shaker attachment transforms the universal magnetic drive into a fast twisting vortex or orbital shaker.

          Innovative operating concept
          IKA TWISTER enables a new way of interaction between user and laboratory instrument. Via the intuitive and chemically resistant 360° LED glass display, all information is intuitively conveyed without any alpha-numeric display. During operation, either the speed or the power required for stirring can be displayed. For example, viscosity changes can be observed and displayed as a percentage.
          Mixing can be started by pressing a button as well as (thanks to integrated beaker recognition) by placing or touching the beaker.
          The reverse function changes the direction of rotation at definable time intervals. This leads to a significant improvement of the mixing result, especially with samples that are difficult to mix.

          Robust and safe
          The high protection class IP 66 allows operation under harsh conditions. IKA TWISTER can thus be cleaned under the tap, for example, or operated in an incubator at temperatures up to 40°C.

          The compact and innovative design has already been awarded the reddot Award 2022. It is particularly suitable for use in laboratories with limited space.

          * Depending on the number of devices, a different power supply may have to be used. The included power supply is designed to power up to two devices.

          The IKA Plate (RCT digital) has a round top made of aluminum alloy. It stirs volumes of up to 20l (H2o) and runs at speeds ranging from 50-1500rpm.

          Some of the features are: IKA emphasizes ease-of-use by design simplicity: reduced forms and operating elements meet the modernity of smartphones: IKA not only focuses on hardened glass because of visibility, chemical resistance and safety, it also optically changes the game of a magnetic stirrer with a glass surface. The IKA Plate (RCT digital) improves over time with regular firmware updates. Using Alnico magnetic technology, the IKA Plate (RCT digital) achieves excellent temperature stability and high residual induction. It also provides for maximum vortex.  The integrated timer and counter function supports the control of kinetics and sensitive reactions; the IKA SmartTemp® function protects users intelligently and predictably.

          Automatic switch-off of the magnetic stirrer if the connected external temperature sensor is not immersed in the medium. Function selectable, timeout time adjustable (Error 5).
