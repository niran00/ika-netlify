            The magic LAB® is a unique and multi-functional small-scale laboratory machine. It is designed for mixing, dispersing, wet milling and incorporation of powders into liquids. The magic LAB® is most frequently used for the development of new products or for optimizing of existing process techniques, particularly in the chemical, cosmetic, pharmaceutical and food industries. It is an ideal machine for continuous, circulating and batch processing with interchangeable modules. Many work parameters of the magic LAB® are identical to those of the IKA 2000 inline production machines: UTL, DR, CMS, MHD, MK and MKO. Therefore, the magic LAB® ensures a reliable scale-up by offering the possibility to work with the same method from formulation development to mass production.
            The basic in-line machine is equipped with the single-stage dispersing module ULTRA-TURRAX® UTL. It is best suited for batch applications and can be adapted for the manufacturing of dispersions from coarse to fine. Compared to a conventional stirrer, the mixing time is reduced by up to 50%.
            Depending on the application, the basic unit can be modified quickly with different working modules.

            Optionally available modules for magic LAB®:
            
            The module DISPAX-REACTOR® DR converts the magic LAB® into a multi-stage high capacity dispersing machine for fine particle size reduction. With just one pass, the module DR does typically achieve fine dispersions with a narrow particle size distribution. It also guarantees an optimum homogeneity, which is an important pre-condition for the long-time stability of emulsions or suspensions.
            
            The module CMS is used for solid/liquid mixing; ideally suited for enrichment of liquids by powders in a recirculation process. It creates a vacuum at the powder inlet, thus sucking the powder directly into the mixing chamber of the machine. It enables a quick, dust and lump-free incorporation and energy-efficient homogeneous mixing.
            
            The module MHD is designed for a fully continuous incorporation of powders into liquids. By use of this module, the mixing relation of solid and liquid should be volumetrically or gravimetrically controlled. Depending on the product characteristics, dispersions with viscosities up to 50 Pas or solid contents up to 80% can be achieved just after one pass.
            
            The modules Colloid Mill MK and Cone Mill MKO are used for wet or fine milling of hard and granular raw materials or for the production of finest emulsions as well as for improving of quality of finished dispersions. The MK module consists of two cones with differently directed flow channels on their surfaces. The cones can be shifted against each other to a minimum distance, thus changing friction as well as flow capacity. By adjusting the milling gap, the particle size can be varied. The MKO module works on the same principle as the MK module except the outlet area of its cones is coated with abrasion-resistant tungsten carbide. This results in an enlarged friction surface that enables to produce even finer suspensions at reduced flow.
            
            The module ULTRA-TURRAX® UTC converts the magic LAB® into a batch disperser when it is inverted and mounted onto a telescopic stand.
            
            The magic LAB® can be extended to a Micro-Plant using a single or a multi-stage inline dispersing machine, as well as a cone or a colloid mill. This is an optimum solution for the development of formulations and processes as well as for the determination of suitable tool. Different process parameters such as speed, shear rate, temperature, pressure and time can be optimized.
            
            There are two versions of Micro-Plants available: The 1 ltr Micro-Plant is equipped with a single-walled open vessel and the 2 ltr Micro-Plant is equipped with a double-walled vessel (possibility to heat or cool the product). Additionally, the 2 ltr Micro-Plant has the provision for special extensions for working with pressure/vacuum. Due to their enormous flexibility, both sizes of Micro-Plants are equipped with circulation pipeline and three-way ball valve to choose in-between recirculation or discharge.
            
            Under continuous duty, the magic LAB® is admitted to temperatures up to 80 °C and a maximum working pressure of 2.5 bar. In short-term operation, the seal materials are resistant for temperatures up to 120 °C. With an engine power of 900 W, the basic configuration with the module UTL performs 26,000 revolutions per minute and a throughput of 130 l/h.
            
            The operation and information display is connected to the magic LAB® by means of a connection cable. Parameters like speed, torque, and temperature can be set and recalled. Using labworldsoft® software, the magic LAB® can be controlled via PC.
            
            The magic LAB® is delivered in a mobile transport box with rollers and drawers for different modules, telescope handle, integrated power supply as well as control and operation display. A state-of-the-art carrying case which accommodates all the modules makes it convenient for the transportation & storage
            
            Advantages of the magic LAB®:
            Flexibility and ease of use: one machine suits for many applications and variety of processes

            The IKA magic PLANT is a laboratory scale process plant for batch wise mixing and emulsifying of low viscous masses up to masses just about capable of flowing. The magic PLANT can be used for a great variety of applications. It is especially suited for processing of products from the cosmetics, food and pharmaceutical industries.
                
            The main advantages of the magic PLANT are its modular design, the integration of several functions with the magic LAB or the ULTRA-TURRAX UTC T25 and the standardizing of components. It can be delivered in the following three configurations:
                
            magic PLANT - basic
            The magic PLANT basic can be used for a wide range of products to be mixed.
            The single components of the product are brought together in the mixing vessel where they are mixed with each other. Depending on quantity and requirements of the process the different components are added to the mixing process via the opened cover or via a dosing socket in the cover. Due to the conical bottom of the vessel it is possible to treat even smallest quantities.
                
            The double jacket of the vessel can be heated for a very effective heating of the mixing product.
            The centrally arranged stirrer is the only mixing tool in the vessel. Wipers are used depending on the type of stirrer.
            Emptying of the vessel is done via the bottom outlet valve. Nevertheless, the vessel can also be tilted or completely removed.
                
            magic PLANT - inline
            The magic PLANT inline is equipped with an effective and versatile dispersing machine type IKA magic LAB with a single or three stage rotor/stator system, flanged to the bottom of the vessel. It is specially adapted to the requirements of batch plants. An effective dispersing/homogenizing is realized by recirculation over the external circulation loop.
                
            These are the most important functions of this machine:
            Creation of turbulences in the lower part of the mixing vessel to avoid sedimentation of the mixing product and the possibility of treating very small quantities
            Recirculation of the product with shearing, i.e. pumping with the dispersing stage
            Recirculation of the product with high shear, i.e. pumping with the dispersing stage at increased speed
            magic PLANT - powder
            The magic PLANT powder serves for efficient but gentle mixing and drying of all free flowing solids, including products with different bulk densities and particle sizes.
            Mixing is done by means of a special spiral agitator, intensively mixing the product in radial and tangential directions.
                
            The possibility to incline the position of the vessel cares for optimum drying of various humid solids of different free flowing behaviour as well as different bulk densities at uniform humidity and temperature distribution in the whole product area.
                
            The main functions of the plant are:
            Drying of powders and granules
            Homogenizing, mixing and coating of powders
            Better mixing and drying result by inclination of the complete mixing vessel
            Complete discharge either through a special valve at the vessel bottom or by tilting of the vessel
            Special stirrer geometry
            Stirrer speed can be adapted to the product characteristics

        features: `
            The magic PLANT is characterized by the following procedural advantages:
            high processable product viscosities
            processing of very small quantities
            better heat transfer from the heating/cooling medium to the product
            adjustable intensity of the mixing/dispersing effect
            to be used as batch-, inline- or powder processing plant

            The IKA ULTRA-TURRAX UTL 2000 is inline high-performance single-stage dispersing machine used for the production of emulsions and suspensions. The UTL 2000 uses the rotor-stator principle and is best suited for continuous applications that cannot be accomplished using conventional stirring methods.

            The UTL single stage dispersing machine is equipped with a mixing tool (generator) that provides moderate shear for the general purpose of blending and homogenizing processes. In order to configure the UTL to meet a variety of application needs, IKA offers a wide selection of generators for all machine sizes. Different generator designs allow adjusting the level of dispersing energy. In addition, they are also designed to accommodate materials of different viscosities and initial particle size.

            The ULTRA-TURRAX in-line machine UTL uses similar shear principles as the popular ULTRA-TURRAX machines UTC for batch operations. The UTL can be used for single pass operations or in a recirculation loop with a batch tank or reactor. Minimized volume of the mixing chamber ensures uniform shear on the product.

            In batch process the machine UTL is arranged in recirculation over a mixing vessel.

            During the full continuous process the components to be mixed are fed into the machine at an appropriate rate through various inlet connections. These components are then thoroughly mixed, dispersed or homogenized within the machine and discharged from the machine through the outlet. Thus, all particles or droplets are treated producing a narrow particle or droplet size distribution with minimal concentration/quality variations. Additionally, the UTL 2000 creates a pumping action which can be used for transfer purposes at low to moderate viscosities with a maximum of about 20 m (ca. 2 bar).

            The high shear dispersing machine ULTRA-TURRAX UTL 2000 is available in eight sizes. The possible throughput varies from 50 l/h up to 125.000 l/h. All sizes of machines work with the same circumferential speed of the rotor which provides for a reliable scale-up.

        description: `
            The IKA DISPAX-REACTOR® DR 2000 is a three-stage high shear inline dispersing machine used for the production of very fine emulsions and suspensions. Shear forces that occur in the working chamber produce a drastic increase of mass transfer and accelerate the dissolving rates of mono and macromolecular substances. Three rotor-stator combinations (generators) in a series ensure small- droplet or particle size and a very narrow distribution spectrum. This process promotes a long stability of mixtures in a single pass, especially when working with emulsions.

            The DISPAX-REACTOR® inline machine uses shear principles similar to the popular ULTRA-TURRAX® machines UTC and UTL. Minimized volume in the mixing chamber ensures uniform shear on the product.

            For discontinuous processes, the inline machine DR can be installed with a batch tank or reactor containing the pre-mixed product. When the mixture passes through the dispersing machine, it is homogenized optimally.

            For continuous processes, the components to be mixed are fed into the machine at an appropriate rate through the inlet connections. Here, the components are thoroughly mixed, dispersed or homogenized within the machine, and then discharged through the outlet.

            In order to configure the DISPAX-REACTOR® DR to meet a variety of application needs, IKA offers a wide selection of generators. The standard rotor-stator (generator) combination consists of a coarse, medium and fine rotor-stator. When installed in a series, this configuration ensures satisfactory particle size reduction while providing optimum dispersing results in a single pass.

            The high shear dispersing machine DISPAX-REACTOR® DR 2000 is available in eight sizes. The possible throughput varies from 80 (DR 2000/03) up to 125.000 l/h (DR 2000/50) when using water. All sizes of machines work with the same circumferential speed of the rotor which provides a reliable scale-up.

        description: `
           The DISPAX-REACTOR® DRS is an inline ultra high shear dispersing machine used to achieve the finest micro-emulsions and suspensions. Extremely high shear rates (up to 190.000 1/s) combined with a fine generator geometry enable crushing of droplets and solids particles down to the nanoscale. The resulting product has long-term stability which reduces the need for emulsifying agents and thickeners. Because of the extremely high energy density, other dispersing aids can be reduced or possibly eliminated.

           The DRS is usually equipped with a two-stage rotor-stator system (generators). The high tip speed of 40 m/s (10.000 fpm) often negates the need for a third stage. The DRS, designed with the same high quality features as the ULTRA-TURRAX® UTL and the DISPAX-REACTOR® DR, is especially well suited for challenging pharmaceutical applications.
               
           The high shear dispersing machine DISPAX REACTOR® DRS 2000 is available in five sizes. The possible throughput (H2O) varies from 700 to 40.000 l/h. All machine sizes work with the same circumferential speed of the rotor which provides for a reliable scale-up.

        description: `
           The IKA MK 2000 is a high-performance inline colloid mill capable of performing wet and fine milling of tough and grainy raw materials. The MK 2000 is especially suitable for the production of colloidal solutions or extremely fine emulsions and suspensions. Excellent dispersing performance allows the IKA Colloid Mill MK 2000 to be used for continuous processes, providing a narrow distribution range of ground particles in a single pass. For challenging milling tasks the colloid mill can be installed into a recirculation loop with a working vessel by means of tube connections.

            For optimum adaptation of the machine to the process it can be equipped with different milling tools. The spiral geared as well as cross geared tools are available.

            The conical geometry of the milling tools enables an axial displacement of the stator for an infinite adjustment of the milling gap. This allows influencing the dispersing effect, particularly regarding tasks with variable raw materials.

            As neither the rotor nor the stator is slotted throughout, the probability of particles passing through the generator untreated is negligibly small. These collective features enable the IKA Colloid Mill MK to achieve the finest particle size reduction, thereby contending with a high pressure homogenizer by attaining similar dispersing results at higher flow rates.

            The IKA Colloid Mill MK 2000 is available in seven different sizes, with varied possible throughput from 200 to 80.000 l/h. All machine sizes can work with the same circumferential rotor speed, which ensures reliable scale-up.

        description: `
           The IKA MKO 2000 is a high-performance inline cone mill capable of performing wet and fine milling of tough and grainy or crystalline raw materials. The MKO 2000 is especially suitable for the de-agglomeration of suspensions. Excellent dispersing performance allows the IKA Cone Mill MKO 2000 to be used for continuous processes, providing a narrow distribution range of ground particles in a single pass. For challenging milling tasks the cone mill can be installed into a recirculation loop with a working vessel by means of tube connections.

            The cone mill MKO 2000 differs from the colloid mill MK 2000 offered by IKA due to its special milling tool. The first stage is identical with that of the colloid mill, geared towards and serves for feeding and pre-milling of the product. Instead of gear cutting tools, the other conical rotor/stator parts are coated with an extremely hard coating that has a very rough surface texture. The coatings consist of high quality materials such as carbides and ceramics. Alternatively, IKA also provides solid tools comprised of zirconium ceramic. The milling tool produces an intense shear zone that can process materials with medium or high viscosities. It generally causes an even narrower distribution and finer particle size than a colloid mill. The wet milling combined with a solid content provides good results even with low viscosity masses.

            The conical geometry of the milling tool enables an axial displacement of the stator for an infinite adjustment of the milling gap. In addition to the rotating speed, the energy input and thus the dispersion effect can also be affected by adjusting the gap between rotor and stator. For applications with a fixed grinding gap and high demands for reproducibility, the infinite adjustment of the milling gap can be replaced by a system with fixed spacers

            The combination of small grinding gaps with the friction between the tools and product allows for an excellent grinding effect. Unlike other corundum mills where tool-wear leads to permanent contamination, the rotor/stator tools of the MKO are not in contact with each other. Special versions are designed in a manner which precludes any metal contamination, even with abrasive products. These collective features make the IKA cone mill a unique device for wet milling and the de-agglomeration of suspensions.

            The IKA Cone Mill MKO 2000 is available in seven different sizes, with varied possible throughput from 25 to 6.000 l/h referring to water. All machine sizes do work with the same circumferential rotor speed, which ensures reliable scale-up.

        description: `
            The IKA MHD 2000 (mixing-homogenizing-dispersing) system is designed for mixing solids (powders, granulates) with liquids. It is predominantly used for fully continuous production processes. The MHD unit is particularly suitable for applications which meet at least one of the following criteria:
            The process should largely occur in a single pass.
            Up to 80% solid concentrations are to be incorporated in a single pass.
            A reaction occurs immediately after mixing.
            The liquid phase is already highly viscous.
            The amount of energy required for the mixing process is to be minimized.
            The solid is a granulate and is to be crushed mechanically as well as mixed.
            The amount of entrapped air is to be minimized.
            The MHD 2000 has two horizontal liquid connections and one vertical connection for the solid material. The liquid phase is fed through the upper inlet normally by means of a positive displacement pump or from a pressurized feed system. The liquid is introduced, distributed across the MHD‘s concentric drum and dosed into the pre-mixing chamber through multiple apertures. The solid is fed vertically into the pre-mixing chamber from the top via a chute, by means of a dosing device (screw feeder, rotary feeder, etc.). The dry feed section and the wet pre-mixing chamber are separated by a feed screw. The liquid and solid phases come into contact in the definite proportions in the pre-mixing chamber. On leaving the pre-mixing chamber, the components are immediately dispersed by an optional rotor-stator system with high shear action, producing a high quality, agglomerate-free product in a single pass. The mixed product is discharged by gravity feed through the liquid outlet at the lowest point on the unit.

            This unique wetting method was developed to minimize air entrapment, which can occur in solid/liquid dispersion systems based on the Venturi principle.

            Throughput of the MHD is set by adjusting the dosage system. The amount of energy required, and thus the degree of mixing, is determined by the speed and the tool configuration chosen. For simple processes such as filling tanks or storage containers, volumetric dosage systems are generally adequate. In the case of fully continuous processes requiring high levels of precision, quantity controlled dosage pumps are used for the liquids and differential dosage scales for the solids. The results are generally accurate to within 0.5% or better.

            The MHD 2000 mixing system is available in seven different sizes with throughput volumes of between 60 and 40,000 l/h. All sizes operate at the same rotor peripheral speed, thus ensuring the most reliable conditions for scale-up.
